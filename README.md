This project the approach to develop tea manufacturing industries with the finest product in Sri Lanka and top contributor of gross domestic product. Currently tea produces use of labour and machine contribution. To improve the production process, firstly it required  information flow with executives to make firm decisions, thus, requirement of condition monitoring in real time has a slight edge for executives to analyse this information.

To improve this, the enterprise resource planning system has to be an added advantage. Initialising this kind of system required a strategy to provide links to the system and executives. Establishment phase is required kind of instincts of current manufacturing system. feedback from respective categories from top to bottom in its hierarchy is very essential to develop the structure of design of software systems. 

This system is able to maintain streamline required information to certain parties, essential to something corporate dissension making. This kind of system needs feedback to keep on updating information availability to resource allocation and labour allocation, in order to keep the production process smooth and identical. Degree of validity of information that is extracted by the system is useful for keeping on the track of the optimal way of tea manufacturing. The ERP base system has incurred those characteristics.
